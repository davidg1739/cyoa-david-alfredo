## You decide to continue going   
   
You continue going through the maze but you notice that you have nothing to help you.   
You start thinking that you want to turn back but you realize that you don't remember the way back.   
You are now walking for two hours and out of nowhere a tiger appers and eats you up!   
YOU LOSE!
